# Explanation
ReactJS is a Javascript library for creating user interfaces. It is the view layer in MVC (Model, View, Controller). ReactJS gives you a template language and some function hooks to output HTML. It is designed so that your program will track “states”, so you don’t have to trace program flow, by tying functionality directly to markup and packages it in a portable, self contained “component”
